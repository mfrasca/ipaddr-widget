# ipaddr-widget

what are we talking about? Nokia, Meego, N9 harmattan, and your own IP address.  Does it ring you a bell?  
- no?  then you probably do not want to be here.
- yes?  read further!

Harmattan (MeeGo, N9) does not have a home screen as fremantle (Maemo, N900).  This small app tries to offer an acceptable solution anyway.

Normally, you would open a terminal, type /sbin/ipconfig, and then scan through the results to recognize the relevant
piece of information.

with this program installed, you hit the icon, and allow it half a second to update.
